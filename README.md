# Marking Rubric
<details><summary>Marking Rubric on hand</summary>
<p>
Marking Criteria:
Your journal will be marked out of 5 and the final mark will only be assigned after the block is complete.
Criteria for marking Journals:
  
  1. Comprehension – You don’t have to document absolutely everything you learn about each
  language, but you need enough information to indicate that you have learned about the basic
  building blocks, have explored a few not-so common components, and are addressing the
  language from the perspective of at least all four quadrants. Consider your journal as a reference
  to the language for future students in CS2613 – would they be well directed by the contents of
  your journal?
  2. Structure and Style – Fashion your journal in a way that a future student in CS2613 could easily
  find the information they are looking for and understand it. Use proper markdown and include
  sections, sub-sections, and hyperlinks where appropriate.
  3. Insight – Demonstrate that you have thought about some aspects of the language beyond simply
  how to code with it. Would a new student to CS2613 reading your journal be able to answer this
  question: Why do we have to learn this language?
  4. Creativity/Uniqueness - The information you present in your journal won’t be original (since you
  are learning from sources), but the way you organize and present it should be. Also, your journal
  will contain a lot of similar information as other students in your learning group, but you must also
  be sure to include some material that you find on your own. When you join your group to put
  together your summary of highlights, will you have anything to contribute?
  5. Quality – Don’t spend forever on your journal entries but spend some time making sure they are
  clear and concise, well-organized, and free of distracting spelling and grammar issues. In the
  words of Dr Bremner (who came up with the journal idea) for this course, “Imagine a future
  employer reading your journal right before interviewing you. Write so that the person interviewing
  will think of you as a peer, rather than an annoying kid”.
